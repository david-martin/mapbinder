= Preparing Infrastructure for Installation

. Ensure you have infrastructure satisfying hardware requirements.
+
Use the https://access.redhat.com/labs/rhmap/[Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.x sizing tool] to find out how many nodes with how many processors, how much RAM and storage are required to run RHMAP. Alternatively, see the https://access.redhat.com/node/2456121[Infrastructure Sizing Considerations for Installation of RHMAP MBaaS] for a full reference of all configurations.

. Install RHEL.

NOTE: See the https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift Container Platform Tested Integrations^] site to decide on what version of RHEL to install.

+
Install RHEL on each machine that will serve as a node in the OpenShift cluster backing the Core or the MBaaS.
Follow the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[RHEL Installation Guide^].

. Register all cluster nodes using RHSM and attach the nodes to the {ProductShortName} subscription.
+
[[register-with-rhsm]]
Perform the following procedure for each node in the cluster.
+
..  Register the node with RHSM.
+
Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the user name and password for your Red Hat account.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager register --username=<username> --password=<password>
----
+
----
Registering to: subscription.rhn.redhat.com:443/subscription
The system has been registered with ID: abcdef12-3456-7890-1234-56789012abcd
----

.. List the available subscriptions.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager list --available
----

..  Find the pool ID for an {ProductShortName} subscription and attach it.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----
+
You will see output similar to the following:
+
----
Successfully attached a subscription for: {ProductName}
----

.  Install OpenShift version {SupportedOCPVersion}.
+
See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/version-3.2/installation-and-configuration/[Installation and Configuration guide^] in the OpenShift documentation for detailed installation procedure.
+
[NOTE]
--
In the OpenShift _Installation and Configuration_ guide:

* Skip steps that you have already performed as part of this procedure, for example, steps 1, 2 and 3 in section __2.2.5.1. Software Prerequisites â€“ Registering the Hosts__,
which describe the registration process.

* Choose the default, RPM-based installation method. See section https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/version-3.2/installation-and-configuration/#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[2.3. RPM vs. Containerized^] for more details.

* Use Node.js Version 4.0.0 or higher when enabling Image Streams. Node.js version 0.10.x and 0.8 are deprecated and will be removed from RHMAP on June 30th 2017.
--
+
Use the https://access.redhat.com/labs/rhmap/[Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.x sizing tool] or follow the https://access.redhat.com/node/2456121[considerations for infrastructure sizing^] to determine how many nodes to configure in your OpenShift cluster.
. Enable Docker to access container images of {ProductShortName} components.
+
[[enable-docker-to-access-rhmap-images]]
Perform the following procedure for each node in the cluster.
+
.. Enable the Subscription-Manager Repo
... For RHEL 7.2, enable the `rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
----
+
----
Repository 'rhel-7-server-optional-rpms' is enabled for this system.
----
+
... For RHEL 7.3, enable the `rhel-7-server-rpms`
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
----
+
----
Repository 'rhel-7-server-rpms' is enabled for this system.
----

.. Install the RHSM plugin `subscription-manager-plugin-container`.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install subscription-manager-plugin-container
----

.. Run `rhsmcertd-worker` to refresh the local certificate store.
+
`rhsmcertd-worker` must be run as the superuser, otherwise it may fail to work without a warning.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo /usr/libexec/rhsmcertd-worker
----
+
To verify that the certificates were downloaded, check the contents of the `/etc/docker/certs.d/` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l /etc/docker/certs.d/ | grep access.redhat.com
----
+
`/etc/docker/certs.d/` now contains directories `access.redhat.com` and `registry.access.redhat.com`.
+
----
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root   67 Jun 01 10:30 access.redhat.com
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root   67 Jun 01 10:30 registry.access.redhat.com
----

After registering each node with RHSM, downloading the entitlement certificates,
and installing OpenShift,
you can proceed to installation of the Core and the MBaaS.
