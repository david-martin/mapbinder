= Enabling Forms Support in OpenShift 2 Targets

Support for using Forms in Cloud Apps deployed to OpenShift 2 targets is not immediately available. It can be enabled by
following the steps outlined in this document.

[NOTE]
This guide only applies to Platform instances with support for OpenShift 2 targets, for example link:http://openshift.feedhenry.com[openshift.feedhenry.com^]. Other targets have Forms support available without any extra configuration.

[[whats-behind-forms-in-the-platform]]
== What's behind Forms in the Platform

There's a service in the back end of the Platform responsible for handling Forms-related operations, called
`fh-mbaas`. Its functions are exposed through the `$fh.forms` API and include access to form definitions, submissions
and deployment of forms.

With Red Hat MBaaS targets an instance of the `fh-mbaas` is always available and doesn't need to be manually enabled.
This is however not the case for OpenShift 2 targets which, by default, don't have the `fh-mbaas` service deployed.
This functionality is provided separately as a service template in the Platform which can be deployed to an
OpenShift 2 target to enable Forms support.

On the OpenShift side the Forms support is implemented through a cartridge. This cartridge is hosted, along with a
Node.js runtime and database cartridges, in a separate application in your OpenShift account and exposes its
functionality to all of your Forms-based applications.

== How to enable Forms support for OpenShift 2 targets

Prerequisites:

* a {ProductShortName} account with support for OpenShift 2 targets
* an existing OpenShift 2 target and an associated environment

The following steps will guide you through the process of enabling your app to use Forms in an OpenShift 2 target:

. Create and deploy an instance of the _OpenShift mBaaS Service_.

.. In the _Services & APIs_ section of the Studio, click _Provision MBaas Service/API_

.. From the list of available services, choose __OpenShift mBaaS Service__, enter any suitable name for the
service instance and click _Next_

.. Wait until the log window shows _Service is ready!_ and click __Finish__. The Service Details page will be displayed.

.. Navigate to the _Deploy_ section in the left-hand side menu

.. Select an appropriate OpenShift-backed environment from the dropdown menu on the right-hand side of the screen

.. Click _Deploy Cloud App_

.. Wait until the service gets deployed. In the _Deploy History_ section at the bottom of the screen, the deployment
status and result are displayed. It might happen that these indicators don't reflect the immediate state. Reload the
page to update the status and check that the correct environment is selected. After the deployment is finished, reload
the page again and check that there's a _Current Host_ field in _Deploy Options_ at the top of the screen.

[NOTE]
--
It may take several minutes for the service to get deployed, as this involves creating a gear, provisioning several cartridges, cloning a git repository and other setup operations. This is only performed once for an OpenShift 2 target. Similarly, the first deployment of a Cloud App might take longer than any subsequent deployments.

..  Write down or copy the value of _Current Host_ field of the _Deploy Options_ section of the screen. The URL points to the newly created OpenShift application which acts as the fh-mbaas service.

.  Set the correct fh-mbaas host URL in an OpenShift 2 target.
..  Navigate to the _Admin_ / _MBaaS Targets_ section of Studio and open an existing OpenShift 2 MBaaS target.
..  Enter the URL of the fh-mbaas service that you saved earlier into the *fh-mbaas Host* field.
..  Click _Save MBaaS_.

Any Cloud App deployed to this new OpenShift-backed environment will have access to Forms functionality.

A single fh-mbaas service can be used to provide Forms support to multiple OpenShift 2 MBaaS targets and can reside on a
different OpenShift instance than the OpenShift 2 MBaaS targets using it. Cloud apps using Forms can be deployed to any
OpenShift 2 target as long as that target has a valid _fh-mbaas Host_ set.
