= Migrating From Roles to Teams

*Teams* is a powerful new system for controlling access to functional areas of the Platform.

This guide presents a comparison of `Roles` based restrictions and the new `Permissions` based restrictions. Each `Role` is compared to the `Permissions` needed to create an equivalent restriction.
