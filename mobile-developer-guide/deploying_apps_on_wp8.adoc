[[deploying-an-app-on-windows-phone-8]]
= Deploying an App on Windows Phone 8

Different deployment options are available depending on the types of the Windows Phone 8 apps.

[[non-company-windows-phone-8-apps]]
== Non-company Windows Phone 8 Apps

Unless an app binary is signed by a Windows Phone company certificate, the app will be non-company app. Non-company Windows Phone 8 apps cannot be OTA installed on to devices directly.

[[building]]
=== Building

* Using Visual Studio
+
In Visual Studio, if no signing options are specified, the final binary will be a non-company app.

* Using the App Studio
+
When using the App Studio to build for Windows Phone, if the "Don't sign the binary" option is selected, the final app binary won't be signed and it will be a non-company app.

[[distribution-deployment]]
=== Distribution & Deployment

Normally you will have two options to distribute and deploy this type of apps:

* Using the Application Deployment Tool provided by the Windows Phone SDK
+
This option is mainly for development testing. If you have Windows Phone SDK installed on a computer, and the target device is a http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769508%28v=vs.105%29.aspx[developer registered device^], you can deploy WP apps using the http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff402565%28v=vs.105%29.aspx#BKMK_tool[Application Deployment Tool^].

* Using the Windows Phone App Store
+
You can https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/AppSubmission/Hub[publish the app to the Windows Phone App Store^] and distribute from there.

[[company-windows-phone-8-apps]]
== Company Windows Phone 8 Apps

A non-company app will become a company app once it's been signed by a Windows Phone Enterprise Certificate. Company apps can be OTA installed on to devices directly and bypassing the app store completely.

To build company apps using the App Studio, you should follow these steps:

[[acquiring-the-enterprise-certificate]]
=== Acquiring the enterprise certificate

Following these steps to get your enterprise certificate:

* Follow the steps in the  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/publish-apps[Publish Windows apps^] guide to create a company Windows Phone developer account. Make sure the account type is "Company". This will cost $99 per year. It may take a few days to process as your company information will be validated.

* Once your developer account is setup, visit the https://products.websecurity.symantec.com/orders/enrollment/microsoftCert.do[Enterprise Mobile Code Signing Certificate^] to apply for the certificate file. Specify the "Publisher ID" field as provided by your Windows Phone developer account. This will cost $299 per year.

* Once the process is completed, Symantec will deliver a certificate that can be imported into the certificate store on a computer. See https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/code-signing-support/index?page=content&id=SO20770&actp=search&viewlocale=en_US[Certificate install instructions^].
+
TIP: Use the same computer when requesting and picking up the certificate from Symantec.

* Finally, you should export the certificate with its private key as a PFX file and protect it with a password. See the http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754329.aspx[Export a Certificate with the Private Key^] guide for instructions.

[[generating-the-application-enrollment-token-aet]]
=== Generating the application enrollment token (AET)

Only the phones enrolled in your company account can OTA install apps signed by your enterprise certificate. To enroll devices, you need to generate the application enrollment token (AET) and install it on those devices.

You can follow the steps in the http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj735576%28v=vs.105%29.aspx[How to generate an application enrollment token for Windows Phone^] guide to generate the AET file manually.

Alternatively, the App Studio can generate the AET file for you during the next step.

To install the AET file on to devices, the easiest way is to store the AET on a web server and ask your users to download it using their devices' web browser. The App Studio can help with that as you will see in the next few steps.

[[creating-a-credential-bundle-for-windows-phone]]
=== Creating a credential bundle for Windows Phone

Once the certificate is available, you can create a new credential bundle in the App Studio.

image:wp_create_credential_bundle.png[]

As you can see in the screenshot, the App Studio can generate the AET file for you. However, if you have the AET file already, you can choose to upload it instead. If you choose to manage the AET file yourself, make sure the AET file is installed on your users' devices.

[[build-the-app-and-sign-it-with-the-credential-bundle]]
=== Build the app and sign it with the credential bundle

When building an app for Windows Phone in the App Studio, you will have the options to sign the app binary with the credential bundles you just uploaded.

[[distribution-deployment-1]]
=== Distribution & Deployment

Once the app finishes building, there will be OTA link and QR code on the download page to easily install it to the users' devices. If the AET file is available as part of the credential bundle, there will be download link & QR code for it as well.
