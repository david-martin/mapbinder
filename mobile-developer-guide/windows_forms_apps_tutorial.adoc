= Developing Forms Apps and Cordova Apps for Windows

.Overview
This tutorial shows you how to create a Forms app targeting the Windows platform using {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}). The same steps as demonstrated in this tutorial also apply to any Cordova app, not just Forms apps.

Currently, there are several issues preventing support for the Windows platform equivalent to the other platforms, as described in xref:support-for-windows-platforms[Support for Windows Platforms]. Specifically, native Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 apps can't be built by the Platform and have to be built manually. Also, Cordova apps need a small workaround to work properly in Windows 8.1.

TIP: This tutorial is also available as a quick https://vimeo.com/130214184[video walkthrough^].

.Requirements
* Windows 8.1 or Windows 10
* 32 or 64-bit machine with minimum 4 GB of RAM
* http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8[Visual Studio 2013 Express^] or higher
* An existing Forms app or a Cordova app in the Platform. See the link:{DragAndDropAppsGuide}#create-a-forms-project[Create a Forms Project] guide for help with creating a Forms app.

[[steps]]
== Steps

[[initial-setup]]
=== Initial Setup

. Download and install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
+
There's an installer available which guides you through the setup. Make sure to include the _npm package manager_ in the installation. It's a core component which will also be required further in this guide.

. Download and install a git client: https://git-scm.com/download/win/. +
Aside from the `git` executable itself, the installer of Git for Windows also provides an emulated Bash shell (called __Git Bash__) and a set of command-line tools in order to provide a familiar development environment. To learn more about the Git for Windows project, see the official website of https://git-for-windows.github.io/[Git for Windows^].
+
NOTE: Most steps in this guide involving the use of command line can use `cmd` or PowerShell, unless otherwise noted. However, we suggest using the _Git Bash_ command line installed in this step for all the steps.

. Install the Cordova package.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install -g cordova
----
+
This installs the Cordova package including a `cordova` executable globally and thus makes it available to all Node.js applications.

. Clone the repository of your app from the Platform.
+
First, you need to upload your SSH key to the platform for git access to work properly. See link:{LocalDevelopmentGuide}#ssh-key-setup[SSH Key Setup] for details.
+
Clone the repository of your app:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <git-ssh-clone-url-of-your-app>
----
+
The Git SSH Clone URL of your app can be found in the App Details.


[[cordova-setup]]
=== Cordova Setup

Normally, Cordova projects are automatically created for your Cordova apps during build in the Platform and the Cordova-specific files and folders are not available in the app's repository. However, when building manually, the Cordova files need to be created and command invoked manually.

Forms apps are based on Cordova and as such they need the same procedure for building as Cordova apps.

. Create a Cordova project.
+
We use the name _winforms_ in this example, but it can be an arbitrary name.
+
[source,bash]
----
cordova create winforms --copy-from <location-of-forms-app>\www
----
+
This creates a new Cordova project and copies the assets from the `www` directory into the newly created project's `www` directory.


. **Windows 8.1 only**: Apply workaround for dynamic content manipulation in Cordova apps.
+
See xref:enabling-dynamic-content-in-cordova-on-windows-8-1[Enabling Dynamic Content in Cordova on Windows 8.1] for more information.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/MSOpenTech/winstore-jscompat.git
copy winstore-jscompat\winstore-jscompat.js forms\www
----
+
The `winstore-jscompat.js` must be included in every HTML file in your Cordova app which does dynamic content manipulation.
+
[source,html]
----
<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">
<!-- these three js files should be included exactly in this order -->
<script src="winstore-jscompat.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="cordova.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="feedhenry.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----

. Add the `windows` platform to the Cordova project.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd winforms
cordova platform add windows
----
+
This creates all the source files necessary to build the binary, including a Solution File (.sln) which can be used to import the project into Visual Studio.

. Add the default Cordova plugins.
+
[source,bash]
----
cordova plugin add \
    cordova-plugin-file \
    cordova-plugin-camera \
    cordova-plugin-file-transfer \
    cordova-plugin-device \
    cordova-plugin-network-information \
    cordova-plugin-battery-status \
    cordova-plugin-device-motion \
    cordova-plugin-device-orientation \
    cordova-plugin-geolocation \
    cordova-plugin-media \
    cordova-plugin-media-capture \
    cordova-plugin-dialogs \
    cordova-plugin-vibration \
    cordova-plugin-contacts \
    cordova-plugin-globalization \
    cordova-plugin-inappbrowser \
    cordova-plugin-console \

[[building-the-binary]]
=== Building the Binary

The app binary can be built from the command line using Cordova or from Visual Studio and supports both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

To build using Cordova:

[source,bash]
----
cordova build
----

To build using Visual Studio, import the solution file (.sln) created in previous step into Visual Studio and build the solution. See xref:building-windows-apps-locally[Building Windows Apps Locally] for details.

Cordova also provides the ability to start an emulator to quickly see the app running:

[source,bash]
----
cordova emulate
----
